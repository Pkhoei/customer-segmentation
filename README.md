Segmenting customers based on behavioral and demographic features to support personalized marketing, retention strategies, and improved customer experience.

This project builds on my previous work in churn prediction, taking the next step into proactive customer strategy through segmentation. While churn analysis helps identify who might leave, segmentation helps understand **who they really are**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify meaningful customer clusters using unsupervised learning  
- Enable personalized marketing based on user profiles  
- Visualize clusters and segment characteristics using dashboards  
- Experiment with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE)

## 🛠️ Planned Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – for data processing and modeling (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`)  
- **Power BI / Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Unsupervised ML algorithms** – KMeans, DBSCAN, PCA  
- **Jupyter Notebook + Git** – development environment and tracking

## 📍 Next Steps

- [ ] Import dataset and perform EDA  
- [ ] Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)  
- [ ] Build clustering models (KMeans, DBSCAN)  
- [ ] Visualize results and business insights  
- [ ] Document findings and push final notebooks
