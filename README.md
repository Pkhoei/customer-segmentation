# Customer Segmentation Project

🎯 **Goal:**  
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their behavior and characteristics.  
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to help businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve services.

📊 **Dataset:**  
A simulated retail customer dataset (or real dataset if added later).  
Includes variables like age, spending score, annual income, etc.

📌 **Main Steps:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)
- Clustering (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN)
- Visualization of clusters
- Interpretation and insights

🛠️ **Tools & Libraries:**  
Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Jupyter Notebooks

🚀 **Next Step:**  
Load the dataset and begin EDA in the `notebooks/` folder.
